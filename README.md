## Python Introduction

### What is Python?

Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991.

It is used for:

- Web development (server-side)
- Software development
- Mathematics
- System scripting

### What can Python do?

- Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
- Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
- Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
- Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
- Python can be used for rapid prototyping or for production-ready software development.

### Why Python?

- Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
- Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
- Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
- Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written, enabling quick prototyping.
- Python can be treated in a procedural, object-oriented, or functional way.

### Good to Know

- The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we will use in this tutorial. However, Python 2, while no longer updated except for security patches, remains popular.
- In this tutorial, Python will be written in a text editor. However, it can also be used in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Thonny, PyCharm, NetBeans, or Eclipse, which are useful for managing larger collections of Python files.

### Python Syntax Compared to Other Programming Languages

- Python was designed for readability and has similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
- Python uses new lines to complete a command, unlike other languages that often use semicolons or parentheses.
- Python relies on indentation (whitespace) to define scope, such as loops, functions, and classes. Other programming languages often use curly brackets for this purpose.
